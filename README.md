4. Copy the file to your Kodi installation folder. 
5. Do NOT start Kodi.exe, start AUTOHDR.exe and it will launch Kodi for you. 

FAQ: 
1. How do I know it's working?
R: Open power settings on upper left corner and check if it says "Toggle HDR OFF". If it says to turn it OFF means it is ON. 

2. I have started Kodi using AUTOHDR.bat but the KODI Graphic User Interface is not in HDR, why?
R: The user interface is not rendered in HDR, when you start a video file that has HDR metadata and your display is HDR capable it will switch your TV to HDR mode. 

3. What about movies that are not HDR?
R: Movies that are not HDR, meaning that those do not have HDR metadata will be rendered in SDR as normal.
